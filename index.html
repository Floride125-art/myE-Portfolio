                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I have invested most my time in working on several projects. It is still the same thing that I have used skills
                   and experience I gained from programming class and I am still learning to emprove day by day.</p>
                <p> This is a website project I designed for the person who own a pizza place and as a way of trying to widen customer base, I decided to create a web 
                  application where the customers order different sizes of pizzas with one or more toppings.

                <p>This is a group project that really contributed toward improving my team work spirit whereby I got to know
                  how to collaborate with my team members and work hand in hand to achieve even more in short period of time.
                </p>
                <p> we have designed this website for helping those who likely to host parties to be able to get gifts delivered to them 
                  easily in short period of time without so much worrying about the time spend or extra expenses while they looking for gifts.

                <p>Delani studio website normally exists but I wanted to design a similar website that looks exactly like it in order to test the 
                  the current level of my programming skills. 

                </p>
                <p> I just designed this website to make it open template for whoever might be interested in using it can refer on the Technologies
                  I have used such as html, css and javascript to come up with that site that looks exactly like the original delanie studio website.

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Big number of people have come accross with this social media called instagram whereby some 
                most of them get to benefit from using that site depending on the number of followers they have or
                connection they create. 

                </p>
                <p> I have used django to design the similar website that work like instagram in order to make it very simple 
                  for those who find it hard to use the normal instagram website we use to post images and videos and followersthose we love.
                  Thus, I made this website to improve the networking between people who might use it.

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Plenty number of people have made different proejcts and some tended to keep them whereby 
                  no one can easily know that they have invested so much of their time in doing them.

                </p>
                <p> So, I came up with idea of dsigning a website which is somehow similar to Awwards whereby people can 
                  posts their projects and get to be known by different viewers.
